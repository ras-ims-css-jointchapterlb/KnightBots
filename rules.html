                  <h2 class="panel-title">Robot Design and Specifications</h2>
              </div>
              <div class="panel-body">
				 <p>You are to design a robot that should fit in a 30 cm x 30 cm x 30 cm cube. The robot should be able to move around 
				 and shoot wooden sticks as arrows. It should also be able to carry a lance for the jousting game. The robot should be 
				 driven using a wireless remote control.</p>
				 <p>You are to design one robot that should play the five different games with minor modifications (replacing the 
				 shooting mechanism with a lance, etc.). Therefore designing and building your robot taking into consideration the required 
				 specifications and the strategies in the different games may be the difference between a dead robot and a winning one!</p>
				 <p>First things first! The robot should be composed of several systems.</p>
				 <p><ol type="I">
					<li>The drive system that is able to move the robot in the field.</li>
					<li>The shooting mechanism that is able to shoot arrows (wooden sticks) at targets, towers, and other robots. 
					This shooting mechanism should be altered to a jousting mechanism for game 4. The jousting mechanism should be 
					able to direct a 60 cm long lance to hit a balloon in the opposing robot.</li>
					<li>The wireless communication system to remotely control all the functions of the robot.</li>
					<li>The power supply to power the robot.</li>
					<li>The flag attached to the robot with the coat of arms of the team printed on a heraldic shield.</li>
				 </ol></p>
				 <p>Physical specifications of the robot should accommodate the above systems. In addition, no mechanism can obstruct 
				 the balloon. You should leave an empty 3 cm x 3 cm area in your robot to accommodate for the balloon.</p>
				 <p>The following figures show a typical robot views along with some 3D views. Dimensions are to be respected!</p>
				 <p align="center"><img src="./img/robotdim.jpeg" alt="Picture" height="50%" width="50%" border="0" /></p>
				 <p>The drive system is responsible for moving your robot on the field. You can use any system you think is good for 
				 achieving this. Two, three, four wheels, or chains, with differential, Ackerman, or any other systems are allowed. 
				 The ground is either concrete, ceramic tiles, or wood.</p>
				 <p>The wireless communication system is any system (Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, RF, etc.) that is used to connect a remote 
				 controller (PS4, Xbox, Mobile Phone, etc.) to the robot. It should be used to move the robot and control the 
				 shooting/jousting mechanism. A driver should use it to control the robot during the different games.</p>
				 <p>The shooting mechanism is used in games 1 and 5. It should shoot arrows (wooden cylindrical sticks of length 10 cm 
				 and diameter of 4 to 5 mm). You should be able to aim it by either moving the whole robot or moving the mechanism as 
				 a turret (using servo motors). The following links are to videos explaining some possible shooting mechanisms:</p>
				 <p><ol type="i">
					<li><a href="https://youtu.be/w9D4GBXbMJU" target="new">https://youtu.be/w9D4GBXbMJU</a></li>

				 </ol></p>
				 <p>Note that the shooting mechanism cannot shoot arrows at angles higher than 45 degrees.</p>
				 <p>The robot should include an automatic reloading mechanism for the arrows in games 1 and 5. It should be able to 
				 reload up to 12 arrows automatically.</p>
				 <p>The jousting mechanism should control the azimuth (and/or elevation) angle(s) of the lance (60 cm long) which 
				 should be fixed on the robot in game 4. You should build the whole system including the lance! Make sure the tip of 
				 the lance is not wider than 1 cm in diameter. The lance should be able to pop a balloon (the use of a needle is suggested).</p>
				 <p>The power supply should be a battery, preferable rechargeable, mounted on the robot.</p>
				 <p>The controller of the robot is open. Any microcontroller or microprocessor can be used.</p>
				 <p>Each team should design a coat of arms and print it on T-shirts they should wear during the tournament. 
				 The coat of arms should also be printed on a heraldic shield and stuck on the flag on the robot.</p>

              <div class="panel-body">
				 <p>Before your robot can take part of the tournament and battle for the great prize, it needs to pass through the Medieval 
				 Inspection and Pitch which is considered Game 0. The team should prepare a pitch and an oral presentation, not longer 
				 than 5 minutes followed by Q&A, to be delivered in front of the inspection jury. The team should explain their strategy 
				 and decision-making process in their design.</p>
				 <p>The maximum score is 30 gold coins, and is divided into as follows:</p>
				 <p><ul>
					<li>The robot exists = 1 gold coin</li>
					<li>The robot can move = 1 gold coin</li>
					<li>The robot can shoot = 1 gold coin</li>
					<li>Automatic loading/reloading mechanism = 3 gold coins</li>
					<li>Coat of arms is printed on T-shirts = 2 gold coins</li>
					<li>Coat of arms is printed on the robot’s flag = 2 gold coins</li>
					<li>Technical Assessment (How well does the robot perform? How professional and technical the work is?) 
					= 5 gold coins maximum</li>
					<li>Cost effectiveness = 5 gold coins maximum</li>
					<li>Design Process = 5 gold coins maximum</li>
					<li>The robot design is not fragile and well executed with creativity and originality = 5 gold coins</li>

				 <p>The tug of war field is 1 m long.</p>
				 <h4>Scoring</h4>
				 <p>Teams will be divided in groups of two and each two robots will face each other in the tug of war field. Each duel 
				 is won by winning 2 out of 3 rounds. Every time a robot participates in a round, the robot scores 5 gold coins. If the 
				 robot wins the duel, it scores a total of 20 points. This means that a losing robot scores either 10 points (if it 
				 loses 2 passes) or 15 points (if it wins one pass and loses 2 passes), while the winner always scores 20 points.</p>
				 <p>The scores of the first elimination round of duels will be used in the final score, along with bonus gold coins

				 <p>The fifth game is the Battle of the Castles. This is not an individual game, rather than a guilds game. Two guilds, each 
				 composed of three to five robots, face each other on the field. The teams composing each guild will be picked randomly and 
				 made public on the day of the tournament. The goal of each guild is to knock down the maximum number of towers and the castle 
				 of the other guild by shooting arrows, while protecting their own, in a battle that lasts 5 minutes. Robots can also knock down 
				 other robots or be knocked down during the battle.</p>
				 <p>The field is a 9 m x 6 m area which is divided into two symmetrical halves. Each half contains one big castle, 2 big heavy 
				 towers, 3 big light towers, 2 small heavy towers, and 3 small light towers placed as shown in the figures below. Each guild has 
				 a 50 cm x 6 m base area where they can handle their robots. And there is a 1 m x 6 m area in the middle of the field that is 
				 empty (considered a neutral territory).</p>

				 <p>The castle is cylnder 85 cm high with a diameter of 30 cm. The 5 Big towers (2 heavy and 3 small) are 22.5 cm high with a 
				 diameter of 10 cm. And the 5 small towers (2 heavy and 3 small) are 12.5 cm high with a diameter of 5cm. The 3D pictures and 
				 crossectional views are shown below.</p>
				 <p>On the other hand, there are two obstacles available for each guild. The first is a one-meter ramp barrier to prevent robots 
				 from passing. And the second is a shield 30.7 cm heigh to protect a tower. Both obstacles can be placed on the field in a guild’s 
				 territory before the battle starts. They are shown in the figures below.</p>

				 the robots, and reloading of the robots can only be done in the base area of the guild.</p>
				 <p>There will be protection around the field, and the team members are all required to wear protective goggles during 
				 the battles.</p>
				 <h4>Scoring</h4>
				 <p>In this game, scoring will be for the guild, i.e., the robots in the same guild will get the same score. So it is suggested
				 that they cooperate during the battle and agree on a strategy where each robot uses its own strengths for the benefits of the 
				 guild.</p>
				 <p>When the battle begins, robots are to knock down towers and the castle by shooting them or knocking them down by driving 
				 through them. In case, a robot accidentally knocks down its own tower, the gold coins for that tower will go to the other 
				 guild.</p>
				 <p>At the end of the battle, judges will score the gold coins for each guild according to the following:
				 <ul>
					<li>The Castle is shot down = 6 gold coins</li>
					<li>A Big Heavy Tower is shot down = 3 gold coins</li>
					<li>A Big Light Tower is shot down = 2 gold coins</li>
					<li>A Small Heavy Tower is shot down = 2 gold coins</li>
					<li>A Small Light Tower is shot down = 1 gold coins</li>
					<li>An enemy robot is shot down =5 gold coins</li>
					<li>Finish the battle on the enemy’s territory without being killed = 3 gold coins</li>
					<li>Finish the battle 1 m away from the enemy’s castle without being killed = 5 gold coins</li>
				 </ul>
				 In total, for shooting down the castle, all the towers, and the enemy robots, the maximum number of gold coins is 40. 
				 Add to it bonuses for finishing on enemy territory, it can add up to 55 gold coins.</p>
				 <p>The winning guild will qualify for the next round and have a 5 gold coins per win as a winning bonus. 
				 This will be repeated until only one guild wins the Battle of the Castles game. All three to five teams in the winning 
				 guild are considered the winners of the Battle of the Castles game.</p>
				 <p>The total score is <b>40 gold coins plus the bonus</b>.</p>
