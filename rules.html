				 <p>The KnightBots: Medieval Robots Championship is the first of a kind robotics competition where robots compete 
				 in five different medieval-inspired games to win the title of the champion along with fame and fortune. After going 
				 through the medieval inspection, the robot shall participate in the first game of target shooting. The second game 
				 is a racing game. The third game is a tug of war game. The fourth game is a jousting game. The fifth game is the 
				 battle of the castles where guilds of three to five robots each, battle each other on the field. The tournament 
				 champion shall be announced after tallying all the gold coins assembled from the six games and the inspection.</p>

             <div class="panel-heading">
                  <h2 class="panel-title">Robot Design and Specifications</h2>
              </div>
              <div class="panel-body">
				 <p>You are to design a robot that should fit in a 30 cm x 30 cm x 30 cm cube. The robot should be able to move around 
				 and shoot wooden sticks as arrows. It should also be able to carry a lance for the jousting game. The robot should be 
				 driven using a wireless remote control.</p>
				 <p>You are to design one robot that should play the five different games with minor modifications (replacing the 
				 shooting mechanism with a lance, etc.). Therefore designing and building your robot taking into consideration the required 
				 specifications and the strategies in the different games may be the difference between a dead robot and a winning one!</p>
				 <p>First things first! The robot should be composed of several systems.</p>
				 <p><ol type="I">
					<li>The drive system that is able to move the robot in the field.</li>
					<li>The shooting mechanism that is able to shoot arrows (wooden sticks) at targets, towers, and other robots. 
					This shooting mechanism should be altered to a jousting mechanism for game 4. The jousting mechanism should be 
					able to direct a 60 cm long lance to hit a balloon in the opposing robot.</li>
					<li>The wireless communication system to remotely control all the functions of the robot.</li>
					<li>The power supply to power the robot.</li>
					<li>The flag attached to the robot with the coat of arms of the team printed on a heraldic shield.</li>
				 </ol></p>
				 <p>Physical specifications of the robot should accommodate the above systems. In addition, no mechanism can obstruct 
				 the balloon. You should leave an empty 3 cm x 3 cm area in your robot to accommodate for the balloon.</p>
				 <p>The following figures show a typical robot views along with some 3D views. Dimensions are to be respected!</p>
				 <p align="center"><img src="./img/robotdim.png" alt="Picture" height="50%" width="50%" border="0" /></p>
				 <p>The drive system is responsible for moving your robot on the field. You can use any system you think is good for 
				 achieving this. Two, three, four wheels, or chains, with differential, Ackerman, or any other systems are allowed. 
				 The ground is either concrete, ceramic tiles, or wood.</p>
				 <p>The wireless communication system is any system (Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, RF, etc.) that is used to connect a remote 
				 controller (PS4, Xbox, Mobile Phone, etc.) to the robot. It should be used to move the robot and control the 
				 shooting/jousting mechanism. A driver should use it to control the robot during the different games.</p>
				 <p>The shooting mechanism is used in games 1 and 5. It should shoot arrows (wooden cylindrical sticks of length 10 cm 
				 and diameter of 4 to 5 mm). You should be able to aim it by either moving the whole robot or moving the mechanism as 
				 a turret (using servo motors). The following links are to videos explaining some possible shooting mechanisms:</p>
				 <p><ol type="i">
					<li><a href="https://youtu.be/w9D4GBXbMJU" target="new">https://youtu.be/w9D4GBXbMJU</a></li>
					<li><a href="https://youtu.be/q3Hczhdc6yU" target="new">https://youtu.be/q3Hczhdc6yU</a></li>
					<li><a href="https://youtu.be/3MsrqL7oEJ4" target="new">https://youtu.be/3MsrqL7oEJ4</a></li>
					<li><a href="https://youtu.be/kYYT4EWn1WE" target="new">https://youtu.be/kYYT4EWn1WE</a></li>
					<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7O1dVTMHyA" target="new">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7O1dVTMHyA</a></li>
					<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHhx3y92gK4" target="new">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHhx3y92gK4</a></li>
				 </ol></p>
				 <p>Note that the shooting mechanism cannot shoot arrows at angles higher than 45 degrees.</p>
				 <p>The robot should include an automatic reloading mechanism for the arrows in games 1 and 5. It should be able to 
				 reload up to 12 arrows automatically.</p>
				 <p>The jousting mechanism should control the azimuth (and/or elevation) angle(s) of the lance (60 cm long) which 
				 should be fixed on the robot in game 4. You should build the whole system including the lance! Make sure the tip of 
				 the lance is not wider than 1 cm in diameter. The lance should be able to pop a balloon (the use of a needle is suggested).</p>
				 <p>The power supply should be a battery, preferable rechargeable, mounted on the robot.</p>
				 <p>The controller of the robot is open. Any microcontroller or microprocessor can be used.</p>
				 <p>Each team should design a coat of arms and print it on T-shirts they should wear during the tournament. 
				 The coat of arms should also be printed on a heraldic shield and stuck on the flag on the robot.</p>
              </div>
             <div class="panel-heading">
                  <h2 class="panel-title">Medieval Inspection and Pitch</h2>
              </div>
              <div class="panel-body">
				 <p>Before your robot can take part of the tournament and battle for the great prize, it needs to pass through the Medieval 
				 Inspection and Pitch which is considered Game 0. The team should prepare a pitch and an oral presentation, not longer 
				 than 5 minutes followed by Q&A, to be delivered in front of the inspection jury. The team should explain their strategy 
				 and decision-making process in their design.</p>
				 <p>The maximum score is 30 gold coins, and is divided into as follows:</p>
				 <p><ul>
					<li>The robot exists = 1 gold coin</li>
					<li>The robot can move = 1 gold coin</li>
					<li>The robot can shoot = 1 gold coin</li>
					<li>Automatic loading/reloading mechanism = 3 gold coins</li>
					<li>Coat of arms is printed on T-shirts = 2 gold coins</li>
					<li>Coat of arms is printed on the robot’s flag = 2 gold coins</li>
					<li>Technical Assessment (How well does the robot perform? How professional and technical the work is?) 
					= 5 gold coins maximum</li>
					<li>Cost effectiveness = 5 gold coins maximum</li>
					<li>Design Process = 5 gold coins maximum</li>
					<li>The robot design is not fragile and well executed with creativity and originality = 5 gold coins</li>

				 <p>The first game in the tournament is the Target Shooting game. In this game, your robot must shoot 10 tower 
				 targets in 2 minutes.</p>
				 <p>The targets are cylindrical towers 12.5 cm high with a diameter of 5 cm as shown below.</p>
